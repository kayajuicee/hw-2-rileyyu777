# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

This repo re-packages the LIGO Open Science tutorial into a small, reproducible research project for **UC Berkeley Stat 159/259 (Fall 2025)**.  
It includes:
- An installable Python package **`ligotools/`** (migrated from `readligo.py`)
- A pinned **Conda** environment (`environment.yml`)
- A Binder configuration so the main notebook runs in the cloud
- Required GW150914 data files (H1/L1 HDF5, template HDF5, and events JSON)
