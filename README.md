# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

This repository is public so that Binder can find it.  
All code and data are based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSCTutorials).  
It restructures the original LIGO tutorial for improved reproducibility, as part of the **Fall 2025 UC Berkeley Stat 159/259: Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science** course.  
Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.

## Project Overview

This project re-packages the LIGO Open Science tutorial into a small, reproducible research project for **UC Berkeley Stat 159/259 (Fall 2025)**.

It includes:

-  An installable Python package: `ligotools/` (migrated from `readligo.py`)
-  A pinned Conda environment: `environment.yml`
-  Binder configuration for cloud execution
-  Required GW150914 data files (H1/L1 HDF5, template HDF5, and events JSON)
